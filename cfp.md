## How can I attend?

Attendance is free for all invited participants and is open to the public, whether or not W3C members.

If you wish to express interest in attending, please fill out the registration form (<span class="todo">WBS to be done</span>. We want to fill the room with people with practical experience of both Web and VR technologies.

Because the venue can accommodate unfortunately only 100 attendees, you must receive an acceptance email in order to attend. Also, be sure to keep an eye on [these important dates](#dates).

As an alternative to the registration form, you are encouraged to submit a presentation topic in the form of a [position statement](#position-statements).

Our aim is to get a diversity of attendees from a variety of industries and communities, including:

> <span class="todo">A list of communities should appear here, e.g.,</span>
> * Manga/cartoon content producers
> * Reading systems
> * Authoring tool providers
> * <span class="todo">etc.</span>


This workshop, as other W3C meetings, operates under its [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).

## How can I suggest a presentation?
{: #position-statements}

This is a workshop, not a conference, and any presentations will be short, with topics suggested by submissions and decided by the chairs and program committee. Our goal is to actively discuss topics, not to watch presentations.

In order to best facilitate informed discussion, we encourage attendees to read the accepted topics prior to attending the workshop.

If you wish to present on a topic, you should submit a position statement (<span class="todo">WBS to be set up</span>) by the deadline (see [important dates](#dates)). Our program committee will review the input provided, and select the most relevant topics and perspectives.

A good position statement should be a few paragraphs long and should include:

* Your background in the main [topic areas](#topics) of the workshop.
* Which topic you would like to lead discussion on.
* Links to related supporting resources.
* Any other topics you think the workshop should cover in order to be effective.
* A focus on technical issues, not process or platform preference. We plan to talk about the what, not the how.
* Position statements must be in English, preferably in HTML or plain-text format. You may include multiple topics, but we ask that each person submit only a single coherent position statement. The input provided at registration time (e.g., bio, goals, interests) will be published and linked to from this workshop page.

## What is W3C?

W3C is a voluntary standards consortium that convenes companies and communities to help structure productive discussions around existing and emerging technologies, and offers a Royalty-Free patent framework for Web Recommendations. We focus primarily on client-side (browser) technologies, and also have a mature history of vocabulary (or “ontology”) development. W3C develops work based on the priorities of our members and our community.
