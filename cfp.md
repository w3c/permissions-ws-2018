## What is the purpose of this workshop?

Sensors, devices, and rich Web APIs present novel and complex threats to user privacy.  This workshop brings together security and privacy experts, UI/UX researchers, browser vendors, mobile OS developers, API authors, Web publishers and users to address the privacy, security and usability challenges presented by a complex and overlapping variety of permissions and consent systems available for hardware sensors, device capabilities and applications on the Web.

The scope includes:

* bundling of permissions,
* lifetime/duration of permissions,
* permission inheritance to iframes and other embedded elements
* relation to same origin policy,
* UIs and controls,
* interaction with private browsing modes,
* implicit permission grants,
* progressive permission grants,
* cross-stack permissions: how OS, browser, and web app permissions interact,
* user consent,
* permission transparency,
* relation to regulatory requirements,
* special considerations for systems that use the browser as a pass-through (e.g. EME and Web Authentication), and
* permissions/transparency/UI as it relates to display-less devices that connect to the Internet,

We aim to share experiences and user studies, leading to a common understanding of when and how to seek user consent for use of various Web platform capabilities. We expect this workshop to lead to concrete and consistent guidance for API authors and implementers and to identify areas for further standardization or research. An important take-away from this workshop should be the guidance on how Permissions API should be designed, both now and in the future, considering the rapid evolution of the web platform.

This workshop will build on the [meeting on trust and permissions for Web applications held in 2014](https://www.w3.org/2014/07/permissions/)

## How can I participate?

Attendance is free for all invited participants and is open to the public, whether or not W3C members.

If you wish to express interest in attending, please fill out the [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1reKYi5jiVnl_x0QkhvOPcXrqRPHvVyJ07YN4a1zlyu0/edit).

Because the venue has limited space, you must receive an acceptance email in order to attend. Also, be sure to keep an eye on [these important dates](#dates).

In addition to the registration form, you are encouraged to submit a presentation topic in the form of a [position statement](#position-statements).

Our aim is to get a diversity of attendees from a variety of industries and communities, including:

* User researchers
* Privacy researchers
* Regulators / policymakers
* Privacy advocates
* Members and representatives of vulnerable groups including:
> * Sufferers of domestic violence/abuse
> * Dissidents
> * People with disabilities
> * People who use non-English UI languages
> * Representatives of newcomers to the internet
> * Representatives of primarily low connectivity connections

## How can I suggest a presentation?
{: #position-statements}

This is a workshop, not a conference, and any presentations will be short, with topics suggested by submissions and decided by the chairs and program committee. Our goal is to actively discuss topics, not to watch presentations.

In order to best facilitate informed discussion, we encourage attendees to read the accepted topics prior to attending the workshop.

If you wish to present on a topic, you should submit a position statement by the deadline (see [important dates](#dates)). Our program committee will review the input provided, and select the most relevant topics and perspectives.

A good position statement should be a few paragraphs long and should include:

* Your background in the main [topic areas](#topics) of the workshop.
* Which topic you would like to lead discussion on.
* Links to related supporting resources.
* Any other topics you think the workshop should cover in order to be effective.
* A focus on technical issues, not process or platform preference. We plan to talk about the what, not the how.
* Position statements must be in English, preferably in HTML or plain-text format. You may include multiple topics, but we ask that each person submit only a single coherent position statement. The input provided at registration time (e.g., bio, goals, interests) will be published and linked to from this workshop page.

Please email statements to the program committee at group-permissions-ws-pc@w3.org.
